# Belling the Cat: The Truth of the Bell
**Concept & Story Design Document**

## 1. Game Overview
**Genre:** Narrative Action-Adventure
**Platform:** Web (Browser)
**Core Experience:** Intense stealth action mixed with moral dilemmas and a shocking narrative twist.
**Visual Style:** Dark, Gritty, Noir-inspired. High contrast.

## 2. Story Synopsis
The village of mice lives in fear of **The Cat**. The only warning system—a bell on its neck—is old and failing. A specialized team is formed to replace it.

### **Characters**
-   **Protagonist (The Volunteer):** A young, radical mouse. Believes the "Belling" strategy is cowardly and ineffective. Wants to kill the Cat to end the thread permanently.
-   **The Elder:** The leader of the council. Conservative, seemingly cowardly, but holds a terrible secret about the nature of their world.
-   **The Cat:** A looming, Lovecraftian force of death.

### **Plot Outline**

#### **Phase 1: The Mission**
-   The Protagonist is chosen for the suicide mission to replace the bell.
-   **Internal Monologue:** He despises the mission. He secretly plans to strangle the Cat with the new rope instead of tying the bell.
-   **The Failure:** During the stealth approach (gameplay), the rope snaps or proves too weak. The mission is aborted.
-   **The Realization:** While close to the Cat, the Protagonist realizes: *"I could have done it. If the rope were strong enough, I could have killed it."*

#### **Phase 2: The Conflict (Narrative)**
-   Back at the hideout, the Protagonist confronts the Elder.
-   **Protagonist:** "Why do we just bell it? We can kill it! We have the numbers, we have the surprise!"
-   **Elder:** "No! You don't understand! The Cat must live!"
-   **The Incident:** Before the Elder can explain *why*, the Cat attacks. The Elder sacrifices himself or is caught, dying instantly.
-   The Protagonist is left with the replacement bell/rope (now reinforced or a new one found) and a dying wish he didn't hear.

#### **Phase 3: The Climax (Gameplay)**
-   A final, desperate run to the sleeping Cat.
-   **Gameplay:** Intense stealth/QTE sequence. The player reaches the Cat's neck.

#### **Phase 4: The Choice**
The player must choose between two actions:

**Option A: Bell the Cat (The "Coward's" Way)**
-   **Action:** The Protagonist ties the bell.
-   **Outcome:** The Cat wakes up. The Protagonist is likely killed in the escape or narrowly survives.
-   **Ending:** The village is safe. The status quo is preserved. The Protagonist dies a "hero" of the old ways.
-   **Tone:** Melancholic but stable.

**Option B: Kill the Cat (The "Hero's" Way)**
-   **Action:** The Protagonist uses the rope to strangle the Cat. Copious button mashing (QTE).
-   **Outcome:** The Cat dies. The village celebrates. The Protagonist is hailed as the greatest savior.
-   **The Twist:** Days later, the mice are partying on the Cat's corpse. Suddenly, a shadow update. A **New Cat** appears. It is younger, faster, and crueler than the old one.
-   **Ending:** Without the fear and caution learned from the old Cat, the mice are unprepared. The village is massacred.
-   **Tone:** Horror/Despair. "The Elder was right. The Old Cat was the devil we knew."

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

### **Dialogue Mode**
-   Standard VN interface.
-   Dark/Red text for the Protagonist's angry thoughts.
-   Shaking text effects for tension.

### **Action Mode (Mini-games)**
1.  **Red Light / Green Light (Stealth):**
    -   Move when the Cat snores (visual sound waves).
    -   Freeze when the Cat shifts or eyes open slightly.
    -   *Fail State:* Instant death -> Retry.

2.  **The Escape (Audio Evasion):**
    -   **Context:** Used when fleeing after a failed attempt or during the final escape.
    -   **Mechanic:** The screen is dark/blurred. The player hears the Bell sound from Left or Right.
    -   **Action:** Influence the mouse to run *away* from the sound.
    -   *Nuance:* The bell is "failing", so sometimes it makes a "clunk" instead of a "ding". This might be a trick (Cat is stalking silently).

3.  **The Approach (Skill Check):**
    -   Walking on the sleeping Cat. Balance mechanic (keep a bar centered).
    -   If the bar hits the edge, the Cat stirs.

4.  **The Decision (QTE):**
    -   **Bell:** Precision timing to tie the knot.
    -   **Kill:** Rapid button mashing to tighten the noose.

## 4. Technical Requirements
-   **Input:** Keyboard (Arrows + Space) or Touch (Tap/Hold).
-   **Assets:**
    -   Silhouette style sprites (Mice).
    -   Giant, close-up shots of the Cat (part of an eye, a paw, teeth).
    -   Sound: Heartbeat, heavy breathing, sharp strings for danger.
